{"id": 3, "prompt": "Explain Python", "response": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's known for its readability and simplicity, with a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages like C++ or Java. \n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing, internet protocols, software engineering, and operating system interfaces. \n\nPython is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting applications. It is used in scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, web development and many more. \n\nPython is an open source language and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. This community has created numerous libraries and frameworks that extend the functionality of Python, making it capable of many different tasks."}
